# Prediction of attack classes of NSL KDD dataset using KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Adaptive Boosted Trees

The dataset is divided in train and test (txt files), which can be obtained from the resources.
Make changes at the input of file by placing approriate path.

Just RUN on Google Collab or Juptypr notebook.

Note: Make sure you run the code iterativerly as some of the variables hold same names.
Example: Confusion Matrix.

# If the python notebook doesn't load

Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.

Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
Paste the link to your notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/govardhananam/Attack-Classes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/KDDCup.ipynb") there and then you get "http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github.com/govardhananam/Attack-Classes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/KDDCup.ipynb"
This site nbviewer works independently of github.

If some notebook rendered in nbviewer appears different from rendered in github, then append "?flush_cache=true" to the end of the nbviewer version url to force it to rerender.
e.g.
http://github.com/govardhananam/Attack-Classes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/KDDCup.ipynb
becomes
http://github.com/govardhananam/Attack-Classes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms/blob/master/KDDCup.ipynb?flush_cache=true
